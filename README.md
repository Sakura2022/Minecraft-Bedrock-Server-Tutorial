This article will start from scratch to explain the process and all the details of setting up a "Minecraft Bedrock Edition" server. I have always believed that only a server you own is a reliable server. So, I spent a few days tinkering with this, and the main purpose of writing this article is also a memo to prevent myself from forgetting. Before we begin, I need to emphasize that this Bedrock Edition server only supports X86/X64 architecture CPUs and does not support ARM architecture. In other words, this server cannot be hosted on a Raspberry Pi. Below is the table of contents for this article.
